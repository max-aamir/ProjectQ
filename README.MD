Hello world
This is my final degree project to be submitted for my B.Tech degree in Computer Science.

This project is a complete solution to host as many quiz events by as many different administrator as required. The quiz that will be hosted would allow registered participants to answer the MCQ type questions. Afterwards the result can be declared by that respective admin.
This project is using Java at the server-side with MySQL database at back-end. You will require a MySQL database to run this. The database settings can be obtained from me by contacting at aamir2expert@hotmail.com

IMP: Admin Sign up key is required for sign up.
